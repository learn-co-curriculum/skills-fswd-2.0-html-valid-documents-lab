# Writing Valid HTML Documents Lab

To build our own websites, we'll need to start with creating a simple HTML file.
In this lab weâ€™re going to get used to writing HTML documents from scratch.

## Objective

- Practice writing valid HTML documents

## Instructions

This lab will ask you to write multiple HTML files from scratch. Each challenge
is in a separate HTML file. Work through the challenges one at a time and run
`learn` to verify you've written a correct solution for each.

#### 1) Write the Minimum Required for a Valid HTML Document in `index-01.html`

#### 2) Write `doctype`, `head`, and `title` tags in `index-02.html`

#### 3) Write `doctype`, `head`, `title`, and `body` tags in `index-03.html`

#### 4) Write `doctype`, `html`, `head`, `title`, and `body` tags in `index-04.html`

#### 5) Write `doctype`, `head`, `title`, and `body` tags in `index-05.html`

- Include a meta tag for a description
- Include a div tag inside body
- Include a p tag inside body

#### 6) Remove All Optional Tags in `index-06.html`

## Conclusion

We often only need to write _one_ HTML document when starting a website. From
the foundation of a valid HTML document, we can build any type of website we'd
like.
